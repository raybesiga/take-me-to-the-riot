# Take-me-to-the-riot

My foray into the Riot ecosystem and how I can use it with Django. This first commit is a Riot to-do app with in-browser compilation. I do not recommend in-browser compilation as it can get impossible to debug. On go for this option if you like to pull your hair out of your scalp.

## Run locally

First you should install superstatic if you do not have that
```bash
$ npm install -g superstatic
```
Clone the repo
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:raybesiga/take-me-to-the-riot.git
$ cd to/this/dir
$ superstatic
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal in your browser.
